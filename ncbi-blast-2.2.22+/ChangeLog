* Bug fixes to lower case masking in blastx.
* Bug fixes to ungapped searches.
* Added support for smaller lookup tables for small queries.
* Added support for partial sequence fetching during traceback.
* Fixed the 2-hit algorithm so that no overlap between two hits is allowed.
* Implemented a new method to compute effective observations and new
entropy-based method to compute column-specific pseudocounts in PSI-BLAST.
* Remote BLAST database data loader is used as a fallback if local BLAST 
databases cannot be found.
* Bug fixes, improved error messages, and support for ASN.1 input in 
makeblastdb.
* Bug fixes and performance improvements to subject masking feature.
* Added the update_blastdb.pl script
* Updated BLAST+ user manual with documentation about configuring BLAST, 
automatic resolution of sequence identifiers, and a description of how the 
BLAST databases are searched.

  formatting options (-D, -f).
* Enhancements to Mac installer to add installation path to user's PATH.
* ASN.1 output is now of type Seq-annot.
