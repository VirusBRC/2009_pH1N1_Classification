2009 pH1N1 Classification

The 2009 pH1N1 Classification serves to describe how sequences are used to classify segments of human or swine viruses as “new pandemic.” From this classification, a classification of the strain to which the segments belong can be derived, using a separate SOP found below "2009H1N1vSOP.pdf".

The procedure was developed by Virus-BRC Co-investigator Catherine Macken (U of Auckland).
